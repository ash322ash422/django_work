This is a simple application  that adds patients, edits the patient data and allows you to view list all patient created.

To run this app follow these 3 steps:

1)Run following 2 commands:

PS C:\Users\hi\Desktop\projects\python_projects\docker_odoo15_postgresql_hospital> docker-compose build --no-cache
PS C:\Users\hi\Desktop\projects\python_projects\docker_odoo15_postgresql_hospital> docker-compose up

2) Goto 127.0.0.1:8069 ( not localhost:8069) and install the Hospital app. The menu would appear on  right hand side. 

3) Click on the Hospital menu. You can create and edit patients. You can also see list of all patients.

Extra Notes for 1st time login, on how to save DB and then restore DB:
1) During creation of DB for 1st time I used following in 127.0.0.1:8069 (NOT in localhost:8069):
Master Password=1111
database name=dbtest
email=ash@gmail.com
Password=1111

2) Initially , in 'Settings', you would not get the option to 'activate the developer mode'. The solution is install any one app, say 'Contacts'.
3) Install Hospital App and create few records.

4)Now create backup of DB (Make sure you are in 127.0.0.1:8069 URL and not in localhost:8069) : 
Logout 
-> on Login  page ( URL=http://127.0.0.1:8069/web/login ) click 'Manage DB' at the bottom.  This will take you to URL 'http://127.0.0.1:8069/web/database/manager'
-> Next to DB 'dbtest', click backup button 
->  Enter Master Password=1111
 Databasename=dbtest
 Backup format=zip

 You will get file like dbtest_2024-09-08_03-10-19.zip in your download directory.

Now you can go back to 'http://127.0.0.1:8069' or 'http://127.0.0.1:8069/web/login' to login.

5) Now I deleted he container and its image. Then I ran 'docker-compose build --no-cache' and then 'docker-compose up'
- Now if you goto URL=http://localhost:8069/, you will get 'Internal Server Error' message.
- So go to URL=http://127.0.0.1:8069/web/database/selector and restore DB from here. Use the zip file that was saved in above step.
  - Databse name=dbtest
- Now goto URL=http://127.0.0.1:8069/web/login and login with previous email=ash@gmail.com, and Password=1111.
You will see all your familiar records and everything.
