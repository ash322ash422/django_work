# django_weather
 I used python3.12 in  virtual env

 *) pip install -r requirements.txt ; (  pip freeze > requirements.txt)

*) Get API id by signing up on  'https://openweathermap.org/home/sign_up'. Its free. Put the appid in  views.py file

*) DO NOT have to apply any migrations. Just runserver: 'python manage.py runserver'
